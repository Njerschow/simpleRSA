In terminal/unix shell, first navigate to the directory using cd

To Compile:

c++ -std=c++14 -stdlib=libc++ main.cpp -o prog 

To run:

./prog


Additional info:

The output folder contains all output files, the file output.txt was an intermediate file and FileWriter.ipynb is a small program to write outputs 1 through 20, feel free to disregard.

Thank you!
